Changes
   * The PSA persistent storage format is updated to always store the key bits
     attribute. No automatic upgrade path is provided. Previously stored keys
     must be erased, or manually upgraded based on the key storage format
     specification (docs/architecture/mbed-crypto-storage-specification.md). #3740
