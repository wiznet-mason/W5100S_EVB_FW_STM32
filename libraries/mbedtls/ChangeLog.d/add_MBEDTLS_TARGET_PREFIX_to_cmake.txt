Features
   * Add MBEDTLS_TARGET_PREFIX CMake variable, which is prefixed to the mbedtls,
     mbedcrypto, mbedx509 and apidoc CMake target names. This can be used by
     external CMake projects that include this one to avoid CMake target name
     clashes.  The default value of this variable is "", so default target names
     are unchanged.
